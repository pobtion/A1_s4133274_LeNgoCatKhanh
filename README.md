Hi Mr. Giang,

When I ran the code using Chrome (guest profile by default) and Microsoft Edge, the website functioned as intended. However, when opening index.html in Chrome under a user profile, the viewport height caused layout issues in some sections.

For the best viewing experience, I recommend running the website on Microsoft Edge.
Apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for your understanding!

Best regards,
